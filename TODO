* clean up \' in Barcelona descriptions ?
* clean up capitalized descriptions in Paris ?
* normalize descriptions ? (e.g. zip codes / town)

DEBUGGING
* display cart corner GPS positions
* display selected item GPS positions
* print out log

UI
* get a nice logo
* replace Toast with proper Dialog
* special icons/colors for empty and full stations
* multiple languages

FEATURES
* properly handle lack of Internet access
* support find specific location
* support new cities
** implement other French cities
** implement other smartbike.com cities
* find a way to support extra data from all apis

* display news from mycitybikes server (e.g. when supported cities change but app version is the same).
** add notifications to Android tray
* display release notes from app

* display statuses (nb supported cities, stations, etc...)

* find a way to display a different icon for empty / full stations. Can we do this without reading all rack statuses ? This would cause many queries if done live...
  Or can we find a way to differentiate stations with recently updated statuses ? Maybe only fetch the close ones. Can we do this without visualy overloading the image ?

* display RSS feed of coming features ?
