DEUGGING

* multiple languages

FEATURES
* handle lack of access Internet properly
* support find specific location
* support new cities
** finish Paris support (speed up)
*** implement other French cities
** implement Barcelona
*** implement other smart bikes cities
* find a way to support extra data from all apis

* display news from mycitybikes server (e.g. when supported cities change but app version is the same).
** add notifications to Android tray
* display release notes from app

* display statuses (nb supported cities, stations, etc...)

* find a way to display a different icon for empty / full stations. Can we do this without reading all rack statuses ? This would cause many queries if done live...
  Or can we find a way to differentiate stations with recently updated statuses ? Maybe only fetch the close ones. Can we do this without visualy overloading the image ?
