Note to eclipse users: the project consists of _2_ eclipse modules. The 'root' one and the one under tests/ (myCityBikes-android and myCityBikesTests). The last one is specialy configured to run the Android unit tests. To be able to run the Android JUnit tests, you need to import _both_ eclipse modules and run them from the myCityBikesTests module. Eclipse can't run the android tests under the tests/ directory from the myCityBikes-android module as the root module isn't configured with the proper test runner.
